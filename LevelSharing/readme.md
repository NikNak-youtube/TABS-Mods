### Level Sharing:
This is a mod for level sharing I made, it allows you to create and publish and play challenges in Sandbox mode in Totally Accurate Battle Simulator
### Installation Instructions
* Download the Assembly-CSharp.dll file
* Locate your TotallyAccurateBattleSimulator folder
* Go to the TotallyAccurateBattleSimulator_Data folder within that one
* Go to Managed
* Replace the original games Assembly-CSharp.dll with the modded one you just downloaded (consider renaming the original to quickly change between modded and original by renaming the files.

### Other mods
There is also other available mods, and also a better explanation of the installation and a video, all available on this google drive: https://drive.google.com/open?id=191mJkD6UQi5NS6jiCURXZrmb4i3HTN7s
### Usage
To start, follow the installation instructions, after you are done, start the game, go to Sandbox, choose a level (any level) and the UI for Level Sharing should show up. Toggle the entire overlay using the Slash (/) button on your keyboard, or minimize and maximize the UI by pressing the "Level Sharing" Button in the top left

### Posting a level
To post a level you will want to go to the map you want to use first, then place all the units the challenge should contain
If you are satisfied with your unit setup, open up the level sharing UI, enter your Level Name in the first Textbox and set your Challenge Budget using the slider.

### Playing a level
To play a level, make sure you are in sandbox mode, press the Get levels button, when the UI is expanded and active, then choose any one of the levels in the list that pops up.

### Possessing a Unit

Some people requested me to incorporate Unit Posession into my mod, since The_FernReaper made a mod that allows this and shared it on the discord, and it fits nicely with the unit creator, so I did just that.
To possess a Unit press F while looking at it

### Some other things
* I would prefer it if you tried your level before posting it, to make sure the challenge is legitimate.
* I will keep the right to remove any level at my discretion, but ill try to make backups every once in a while so if you feel like the removal was illegitimate, you can contact me
* I hope this will be used responsibly, if you just spam my database I will ban you.
* You can currently cheat by editing the other army, but please just be a good sport.
